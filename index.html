                        <p>Currently writing my dissertation, researching IoT devices, Intrusion detection and WIFI probing. My product aims to provide 'hidden' security measures for a network admin.

                        <br>
                        The product can capture probe packets in real time, store them in date specific files (backed up to server). Necessary data is extracted from packets and this can be reported back to admin via email or directly in terminal.
