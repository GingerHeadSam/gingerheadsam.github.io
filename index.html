                        <h3> Dissertation - Awarded 1st Class<span class="arrow">&#x25BC;</span> </h3>
                        <p>My dissertation written during my final year of university involved researching IoT devices, Intrusion detection and WIFI probing. Alongside my report, I created a product which aimed to provide 'hidden' security measures for a network admin.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The product can capture probe packets in real time, store them in date specific files (backed up to server). Necessary data is extracted from packets and this can be reported back to admin via email or directly in terminal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before starting this project I had no prior knowledge surrouding any of the tools used. Throughout the duration of my dissertation project I taught myself everything I needed to know to enable me to create the best project possible.
